Sara Meyberg is a dedicated artisan who found her passion for crochet in the quiet moments of life. Every piece is a reflection of care, attention to detail, and a desire to bring comfort to others. 

**Our Materials:**  
We use high-quality yarns sourced from sustainable, ethical suppliers. 

**Our Process:**  
Each item is crocheted by hand, ensuring uniqueness and durability. No two pieces are exactly alike.
